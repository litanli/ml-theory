These are some ML algorithms coded from scratch whilst learning the math behind them. The fit and inference logic is contained in the fit and predict/transform methods of each estimator, and the estimators themselves follow sklearn's estimators API https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/develop.html.

Each module should be accompanied by a compare file that runs a simple comparison between the from-scratch version and the corresponding sklearn estimator.
